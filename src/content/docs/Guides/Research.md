description: Research opportunities for ASU CS students, and How to get into a research lab.
---

Getting into research might seem intimidating at first, but it’s actually more approachable than you think! A great first step is reaching out to professors whose work sounds interesting to you. Take a look at their lab website, skim their recent papers and submissions, and send a short, friendly email introducing yourself and sharing why you’d love to learn more. Be concise and share a little bit about your background in the field and your interest in their lab work.

 Don’t worry if you don’t have tons of experience yet; most professors care more about curiosity and initiative. While cold-emailing might feel awkward at first, it’s how a lot of students get started. On top of that, ASU has amazing programs like the [Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative (FURI)](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/furi/) and the [Barrett Fellows Program](https://students.barretthonors.asu.edu/barrett-fellows), which give you mentorship and a structured way to dive into research and potentially publish papers. Between sending a few emails and applying to programs like these, you’ll be surprised how many doors open up for hands-on experience!

Keep an eye out for lab opportunities through your school emails and network with grad/PhD students in your target fields. Coffee chats are a great way to learn more about their research and identify key areas you want to explore further and help you broaden your persective and interests.

## finding professors to work with

- Start by browsing through ASU faculty pages and looking for professors whose research genuinely interests you and/or professors you have taken classes with and love their work
- **Pro tip:** Look for professors who joined ASU recently (within the last 2-3 years). They're actively building their labs and are more likely to have open spots
- Check out ASU News, department newsletters, and research highlights to discover interesting work happening on campus
- Don't limit yourself to just CS faculty - interdisciplinary research is huge, so explore other departments too

## cold-emailing professors

- It's a numbers game. Expect to send 25-30 emails to get 2-3 responses. Don't take it personally when you get ghosted, they get a lot of emails too
- Keep your emails short and sweet - professors are busy people who respect concise communication
- **Email structure that works:**
  - Brief intro (year, major, relevant coursework)
  - Why their specific research interests you (mention a recent paper or project)
  - What you're hoping to learn/contribute
  - Ask for a short meeting to discuss opportunities
- **For larger, established labs:** Don't just email the PI (Principal Investigator). Email PhD students and postdocs too - they're often more responsive and can be a friendlier introduction into the lab
- Time your emails - avoid Fridays, finals week and winter break

## your first research meeting

- **Come prepared:** Read 1-2 recent papers and skim 5-6 research abstracts from the lab, prepare thoughtful questions and understand the overall direction of the lab. 
- **What TO bring up:**
  - Your academic background and relevant skills
  - Specific aspects of their research that excite you
  - Your time availability and commitment level
  - Questions about the lab culture and expectations
- **What NOT to bring up:**
  - Asking about immediate publication opportunities (you're not ready yet)
  - Demanding guaranteed outcomes or credit
  - Being vague about your interests ("I just want to do research")
- **Be honest about your skill level** - professors would rather teach you properly than deal with someone who oversells their abilities

## starting research (freshman year reality check)

- **Bad news:** Unfortunately, you can't do FURI in your first semester and most labs don't hire freshmen as paid researchers
- **Good news:** Many professors are happy to have enthusiastic volunteers, especially if you're willing to learn and support ongoing work at the lab
- **Your value as a freshman isn't your skills (yet) - it's your passion and willingness to show up:**
  - Be proactive and willing to learn, attend lab meetings, and ask questions
  - Stay consistent and reliable, communicate early and often if you are facing any issues
  - Bring a fresh perspective and curiosity to the topic of research
- Don't get discouraged if the work feels basic at first. Everyone starts by taking hours to read papers and do literature reviews. (**Bonus Tip**: there are several chrome extensions that can help you read papers faster and more efficiently, such as [Alice](https://alice.aryankeluskar.com/))

## building your research foundation

- **Math is everything:** Be confident with Statistics and Linear Algebra if you're doing ML/AI research. You will need the fundamentals at every stage.
- Learn to read academic papers - it takes practice to comprehensively understand the problem and the solution. Start with survey papers, since they are not too technical and slowly work your way up to cutting-edge research.
- **Don't pretend to know things you don't** - professors would rather teach you the right way than correct bad habits later
- Version control (Git) and best practices for Python programming will save you a lot of pain
- **Soft skills matter:** Learn to present your work clearly and concisely, write clean code, and document everything. When it comes to writing a paper, you will need to explain why you made the decisions you did, and what were the exact outcomes of every experiment you ran.

## general research survival tips

- **Respect everyone's time** - show up prepared, meet deadlines, communicate proactively
- **Have fun with it** - don't get so stressed about impressing people that you forget why research is cool
- **Submit work early** - academic deadlines are real deadlines. Conference submission deadlines don't get extended for your convenience
- **Network actively** - attend lab meetings (even other labs'), go to department talks, chat with grad students
- **Be grateful** - professors mentoring undergrads are doing extra work. A simple "thank you" goes a long way
- **Explore broadly** - ASU has research in everything from VR education to AI ethics to speech therapy. Don't jump on the first opportunity you get

Getting into research might seem intimidating at first, but it’s actually more approachable than you think! A great first step is reaching out to professors whose work sounds interesting to you. Take a look at their lab website, skim their recent papers and submissions, and send a short, friendly email introducing yourself and sharing why you’d love to learn more. Be concise and share a little bit about your background in the field and your interest in their lab work.

 Don’t worry if you don’t have tons of experience yet; most professors care more about curiosity and initiative. While cold-emailing might feel awkward at first, it’s how a lot of students get started. On top of that, ASU has amazing programs like the [Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative (FURI)](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/furi/) and the [Barrett Fellows Program](https://students.barretthonors.asu.edu/barrett-fellows), which give you mentorship and a structured way to dive into research and potentially publish papers. Between sending a few emails and applying to programs like these, you’ll be surprised how many doors open up for hands-on experience!

Keep an eye out for lab opportunities through your school emails and network with grad/PhD students in your target fields. Coffee chats are a great way to learn more about their research and identify key areas you want to explore further and help you broaden your persective and interests.

# Why this wiki exists

Ever tried finding advice about a CS course at ASU? You end up digging through old Reddit threads, asking in Discord servers, texting that one friend who took it last semester, and hoping someone in your group chat has the inside scoop. The information is out there, scattered like breadcrumbs across the internet.

That's where this wiki comes in. Instead of hunting through the digital sludge pile for that one helpful comment about CSE 310 study tips or how to prepare for internship interviews, we've curated the collective wisdom of ASU CS students into one place. No algorithms deciding what you see, no outdated posts from 5 years ago, just the good stuff organized and ready when you need it.

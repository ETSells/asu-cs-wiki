### Data Structures and Algorithms

**Course Description:** This course covers advanced data structures and algorithms, including stacks, queues, trees (BST, B+), and graphs. Searching for graphs, hashing, and sorting.

**Course Objectives:**
1. Define data structures (types) such as heaps, balanced trees, hash tables.
2. Explain how to use a specific data structure in modeling a given problem (e.g. I can explain how to
model a dictionary using balanced trees).
3. Identify, construct and clearly define a data structure that is useful for modeling a given problem.
4. State some fundamental algorithms such as merge sort, topological sort, Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm,
and algorithmic techniques such as dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.
5. Use a specific algorithmic technique in solving a given problem (e.g. I can write a dynamic program that
solves a shortest-path problem).
6. design an algorithm to solve a given problem
7. Define the notions of worst-case/best-case/average-case running times of algorithms.
8. Analyze and compare different asymptotic running times of algorithms.
9. Analyze a given algorithm and determine its asymptotic running time.
10. Combine fundamental data structures and algorithmic techniques in building a complete algorithmic
solution to a given problem.
11. Create several algorithmic solutions to a given problem and choose the best one among them according
to given requirements on time and space complexity

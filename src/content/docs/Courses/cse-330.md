### Useful Tools
These are some of the tools that are useful for this course (contributions welcome!)
- [Brickyard Computer Lab](https://brickyard.asu.edu/) - Free desktops with Windows environment to compile and run your kernels.
- [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app) - Virtualbox alternative for MacOS (although I recommend using Brickyard, since running kernels on Mac is not recommended).
- [Stranger Things](https://www.netflix.com/title/80057281) - An excellent way to kill time while you wait for your kernel to compile (~3 hours for every project).

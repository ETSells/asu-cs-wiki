### Theoretical Computer Science

**Course Description:** This course covers the theoretical foundations of computer science, including computability, complexity, and formal languages.

**Course Objectives:**
1. Regular Language, which model computing machines with finite fixed memory, and the class of regular languages, which is used for pattern matching languages
2. Context-free Language, which facilitate declarative specifications of language syntax
3. Computability Theory, which addresses the inherent limits of what can be solved by a computer (decidability)
4. Complexity Theory, which helps us measure the time and space used to solve a problem.


### Useful Tools
These are some of the tools that are useful for this course (contributions welcome!)
- [NFA to DFA Converter](https://joeylemon.github.io/nfa-to-dfa/) - Convert NFA to DFA, with cool visualizations.
- [Regex Tester and Debugger](https://regex101.com/) - Test and debug your regexes.
- [Veritasium Video](https://youtu.be/HeQX2HjkcNo?si=_ji5JAdC-tXMEsLw) - 33 mins banger video on the halting problem, covers a huge chunk of the syllabus and my professor even played it in class.
- [Easy Theory (Previous Prof.)](https://www.youtube.com/@EasyTheory) - These videos are a life saver, they cover a lot of the material and are very easy to understand.

### Student Reviews

- **Review 1**: "Literally the best course I've taken at ASU. My professor was very engaging, hilarious in class, and the material is very well explained. The only downside is that the exams are hard, but that's expected for a theoretical course and EasyTheory is a lifesaver. We also took a group photo at the end of the semester :)"
